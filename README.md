###Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project
*The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and
clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis.*

##Files
* "CodeBook.md" describes the dataset, variables, transformations done to create the final
output data.
* "run_analysis.R" is the script used to transform the data.
* The script writes the final output of the transformations to the file "tidy.txt".
